# msmt_dr_longitudinal_21-23
repo for a manuscript describing msmt longitudinal data from 2021-2023

## Step 1: clean metadata, AA tables, and fastq files
The analysis for this manuscript originally included metadata, AA tables, and
fastq files that were not part of the final manuscript. This is because
sequencing is not yet complete for other regions of Tanzania outside of Kagera,
so there is some metadata for samples that haven't been sequenced yet, and some
sequencing that is not ready for publication yet. To create a clean dataset for
manuscript deposition, we added some cleaning scripts, which are described in
the clean_kagera folder.
